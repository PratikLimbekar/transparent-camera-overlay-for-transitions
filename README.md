# transparency_camera_overlay_for_transitions

## NOTE
You may download the apk from the Repository and use it. But keep it in mind that the recording DOESN'T STOP when you hit the pause button. I was too lazy to implement that. What you instead do is cut the video in between using a video editing app instead. 

Thank you for your interest, and sorry for my laziness. I created it enough to get my job done.
